# ToDo Lists Creator

Simple ToDo app in React+Redux+Firebase. 

[note: app is not properly redux'ed yet :( ]

You can create own todo lists, edit, delete and filter them.
For each list you can add own todos, edit, delete, mark as "completed" and filter them. 
Login required to use any app functionality. Todo chat ;) as bonus.
App should work on any latest browsers, preferably Chrome.
